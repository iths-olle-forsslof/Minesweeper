MineSweeper created with canvas.

Rules for success:
1. The first tile you click should never be a mine, and should always be blank.
2. When clicking an empty tile - create a "wave" that sweeps the board until it hits a tile next to a mine.
3. Should be able to right click to mark a mine.
4. Should have at least two different difficulties.
